            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>SCP-002 must remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times. In case of total power failure, containment area must be sealed, and personnel must evacuate immediately.</p>
            
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>SCP-002 appears to be a large, tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 cubic meters. An entryway on one side leads to an interior that resembles a furnished apartment. However, all furniture and items inside are composed of bone, hair, and other biological material.</p>
            <p>Testing has revealed that items found inside SCP-002 are, in fact, the remains of previous victims.</p>
            
            <h3>Discovery:</h3>
            <p>SCP-002 was discovered in a crater caused by an unknown impact event. It was recovered by the SCP Foundation and transported under heavy security.</p>
            
            <h3>Incident Report:</h3>
            <p>Several personnel went missing during early containment. Further investigation revealed that SCP-002 assimilates individuals who enter its interior, converting them into new pieces of furniture.</p>
