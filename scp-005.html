            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. However, due to its unique function, special measures are required to restrict access. Removal from its containment area requires approval from at least one Level 4 personnel.</p>
            
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>SCP-005 is an ornate key resembling a typical mass-produced key from the 1920s. It was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high-security facility.</p>
            <p>SCP-005 appears to have the ability to unlock any form of lock, mechanical or digital, with ease. The origin of this ability remains unknown.</p>
            
            <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
            <p>While SCP-005 has been tested on various locking mechanisms, it appears ineffective against devices whose locking purpose is disguised or obscured. Further tests are being conducted to determine the extent of SCP-005â€™s cognitive capabilities.</p>
