            <h2>Item #: SCP-003</h2>
            <h3>Object Class: Euclid</h3>
            
            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.</p>
            <p>In the event of total power failure, personnel must use direct skin contact to prevent SCP-003 from reaching activation temperature.</p>
            
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.</p>
            <p>SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of biological material arranged similarly to a computer motherboard, predating modern circuit boards by thousands of years.</p>
            <p>SCP-003-2, a stone tablet covered in unknown runes, appears to have been designed to contain SCP-003-1.</p>
            
            <h3>Addendums:</h3>
            <p>Further research suggests SCP-003-1 may be sentient. During an anomalous event, it briefly took the form of a humanoid entity before being re-contained.</p>
